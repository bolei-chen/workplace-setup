\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Toolkits and Craftsmanship}

\begin{frame}
\large
      \begin{itemize}
      \item
      As I said in the Introduction, as programmers, you will learn
      \alert{many languages} over your career, and some will prove to
      be long-lived.  C is likely to be one of the long-lived languages.

      \item
      Right now, of course, in the main lectures I'm teaching you all the
      basic material about how to program clearly and elegantly in C.
      \pause

      \pitem
      These Programming Tools lectures stand separately from the main
      C lectures. In these I'm going to try to convince you that you need
      to invest time building a {\bf toolkit} of tools and libraries and the
      {\bf craftsmanship} to use them well.
      This will make your C programming easier and more productive,

    \pitem
      The goal is to make you look like a \alert{master craftsman} - an expert C programmer.

    \pitem
      When necessary: don't be afraid to \alert{Build your own Tools!}
    \pitem
      The Core Principle: \alert{Ruthless Automation}.
    \pitem
      Doing something boring and repetitive?
    \pause
      especially for the second or third time?
    \pitem
      You are a \alert{programmer}, automation is your core skill -
      so think:
      \alert{Can I save time by automating this boring task?}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Recommended Books}

\begin{frame}

For these Programming Tools lectures, I strongly recommend two books:

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.27\textwidth]{tpp}
	\hspace{2cm}
	\includegraphics[width=0.27\textwidth]{tpop}
\end{center}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    \alert{The Pragmatic Programmer (PP)}, by \alert{Hunt \& Thomas}.
    The carpentry metaphor - and a series of excellent Programming Tips -
    comes from there.

    \pause
    \item
    \alert{The Practice of Programming (PoP)}, by \alert{Kernighan \& Pike}.
    %There's some overlap with \alert{The Pragmatic Programmer},

    \end{itemize}

    Both books are brilliant expositions of expert-level
    programming craft.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Contents}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \myheading{Contents}
  Today, we'll cover:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item
          \alert{Programmer's Editors:} Use a single editor well.
        \item
	  \alert{Automating Compilation:} Use make.
        \item
   	  \alert{Multi-Directory Programs and Libraries:} How to lay out
	  programs in multiple directories, a Makefile per directory.
        \item
	  \alert{Automating Compilation:} alternatives to make.
	\end{itemize}
    \pause

    Notes:


    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    The handout (these slides) and a tarball (of examples and tools) are available on Scientia.

    \item
    As a shorthand \alert{tarball 01.intlist} refers to the directory
    called {\bf 01.intlist} inside the examples tarball.
    Each directory contains a README file (and indeed there's a top-level README).
    Read them - and if they tell you to do something, do it right away!
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\section{Programmer's Editors}
\subsection{Use a Single Editor Well (PP tip 22)}

\begin{frame}
  \myheading{Programmer's Editors}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
	  Hunt \& Thomas write (in Tip 22):
\begin{quote}
Use a Single Editor Well:
The editor should be an extension of your hand;
make sure your editor is configurable,
extensible and programmable.
\end{quote}
    \pitem
    As a programmer, you will spend \alert{years of your life} editing programs.

    \item
    Coding might be 80\% thinking and 20\% typing, but your
    typing must not interfere with your thought process.

    \pitem
    So: Explore several programmer's editors, then choose one,
    and learn to become \alert{expert in it}.

    \pitem
    That includes: learning \alert{how to plug external tools in}.

    \pitem
    Which editor?
    \pause
    It's more than my life's worth to tell you which editor to use.

    \pitem
    Why? Because programmers are notoriously sectarian when it comes to..
  \end{itemize}

\end{beamercolorbox}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
       The leading Programmer's editors are (probably) \alert{vim} and \alert{emacs}:

\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{vimLogo}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{emacsLogo}

    \pitem IDEs such as \alert{VSCode}, \alert{Idea} and \alert{CLion}
          provide an editor, an automated compilation system
	  and a debugging environment.
	  If you're going to use an IDE,
          learn how to use it well, and
          how to extend and program it.

     \pitem
     Note that \alert{Hunt \& Thomas} aren't much in favour of IDEs.
     They say "We need to be comfortable beyond the limits imposed by an IDE".
     Knottenbelt \& White aren't that keen on them either.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

Actually, it's well known that \alert{Real Programmers use Butterflies}
to edit source code:

\section{Automatic Compilation}
\subsection{Make (tarball 01.intlist)}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\myheading{Automatic Compilation}
    When multi-file C programming, there are \alert{many source files}, eg:
    \par\noindent
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics<1->[height=3.8cm]{diagram-0.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \par\noindent
    \pause
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Module \alert{intlist} comprising two files (interface \alert{intlist.h} and implementation \alert{intlist.c}) - defining a list-of-integers type.
      \pause
      A separate basic definitions header file \alert{defns.h},
      \pitem A unit test program \alert{testlist.c}, that uses and tests \alert{intlist},
      \pitem A main program \alert{avgwordlen.c}, that uses intlists to do something vaguely useful.
      %(reads words from a file, builds a list of the lengths of those words, and then computes the average word length).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    So, what should we compile?  what should we link?
    \pitem
    What we shouldn't do: \alert{gcc -Wall *.c}.  Why not?  Try it and see!

    \pitem
    Without Make, the correct way to make gcc compile and link everything is:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \pause
    \item
    Tell gcc to compile every .c file onto a corresponding object (.o) file, either all together:
\begin{verbatim}
  gcc -Wall -c *.c
\end{verbatim}
    or one at a time: foreach .c file:
\begin{verbatim}
  gcc -Wall -c THAT.c
\end{verbatim}

    \pause
    \item
    Then link each main program's .o file with the .o files of all the modules it uses (directly
    or indirectly), creating a named executable:

\begin{verbatim}
  gcc avgwordlen.o intlist.o -o avgwordlen
  gcc testlist.o intlist.o -o testlist
\end{verbatim}

    \end{enumerate}

    \pitem
    But this is really painful, far too complex for us to do repeatedly.

    \pitem
    We \alert{need a tool to handle automatic compilation and linking}.

    \pitem
    That tool is \alert{make}.
    \pause
    But for it to do the job, we have to \alert{tell it the rules}:
    when should each .c file be recompiled, and when should each executable be relinked from it's
    collection of object files.

    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    The key information that \alert{make} will need is related
    to \alert{dependencies} between the source files - determined by the \alert{\#include} structure.
    \pause
    See this via:
\begin{verbatim}
grep '#include' *.[ch] | grep '"'
\end{verbatim}

    \pitem
    Which gives:
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
intlist.c:#include "intlist.h"
avgwordlen.c:#include "intlist.h"
avgwordlen.c:#include "defns.h"
testlist.c:#include "intlist.h"
\end{verbatim}
}

    \pitem \alert{intlist.c} includes \alert{intlist.h}
            (to check implementation vs interface).
    \pitem \alert{avgwordlen.c} includes \alert{intlist.h} (because it uses intlists) and \alert{defns.h}.
    \pitem \alert{testlist.c} includes \alert{intlist.h}

    \pitem
    {\bf Make} needs such file dependencies,
    encoded as {\bf Makefile} dependency rules between
%    to automatically compile and link your programs.
%
%    \item
%    The Makefile contains dependency rules between
    \alert{target} and \alert{source} files with
    \alert{optional actions} (commands) to generate each
    target from the corresponding sources.
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\begin{itemize}
\item
    Here's the Makefile for our example.  It starts with some \alert{variable} or \alert{macro}
    definitions:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
CC      = gcc
CFLAGS  = -Wall
BUILD   = testlist avgwordlen
\end{verbatim}

\verb+$(CC)+ sets which C compiler to use,
\verb+$(CFLAGS)+ is the C compiler flags, \verb+$(BUILD)+ the targets to build.
Note that environment variables automatically become macros, eg \verb+$(HOME)+
represents your home directory.

\pitem
The remainder of the Makefile lists the target/sources/action rules:

\begin{verbatim}
all:    $(BUILD)
clean:
        /bin/rm -f $(BUILD) *.o core
\end{verbatim}

\pause
\begin{verbatim}
testlist:       testlist.o intlist.o
avgwordlen:     avgwordlen.o intlist.o
avgwordlen.o:   avgwordlen.c intlist.h defns.h
testlist.o:     testlist.c intlist.h
intlist.o:      intlist.c intlist.h
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]

\begin{itemize}
      \item
	Note that Make needs very few explicit actions,
	because it already knows how to compile \alert{.c} files onto the corresponding \alert{.o} file, and how to link several \alert{.o} files together with the C library.

      \pitem
      So, when you write the rule:
\begin{verbatim}
intlist.o:      intlist.c intlist.h
\end{verbatim}

      \pause
      Make expands it to the more complete compilation rule:

\begin{verbatim}
intlist.o:      intlist.c intlist.h
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c intlist.c
\end{verbatim}

      \pitem
	This rule declares that \alert{intlist.o} is up
	to date only if it is \alert{newer than intlist.c and intlist.h}.
	If \alert{intlist.o doesn't exist} or \alert{is older than either file},
	then the action is triggered - compiling \alert{intlist.c}, producing \alert{intlist.o}.
      \pitem
        \alert{make} takes optional target names on the command line
	(defaulting to the first target),
        then performs the \alert{minimum number of actions}
	needed to bring the desired targets \alert{up to date},
	based on the \alert{timestamps} of the target and source files.
	
%      \pitem
%        Common extra targets include
%	\alert{test}, alert{tar} and \alert{install},
%	as in:
%
%\small
%\begin{verbatim}
%install:        avgwordlen
%        install -m0755 avgwordlen $(HOME)/bin/$(ARCH)
%\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\begin{itemize}
      \item
       For example, if \alert{intlist.h} is altered, you run \alert{make},
       that builds the target \alert{all}, which recursively applies all
       the rules checking timestamps and concludes that...

       \pitem
       %...\alert{intlist.c},
       %\alert{testlist.c} and \alert{avgwordlen.c} need recompiling,
       %and then the new \alert{testlist.o} and \alert{avgwordlen.o}
       %need relinking against the new \alert{intlist.o}, giving the
       %2 executables \alert{testlist} and \alert{avgwordlen}.
       ...everything needs to be recompiled and linked.

      \pitem
      If, instead, \verb+make+ is run after \alert{intlist.c} is modified,
      it figures out that it needs to recompile \alert{intlist.c},
      and relink both executables against the
      new \alert{intlist.o}.

      \pitem
      If, instead, \verb+make+ is run after nothing is modified,
      it figures out that nothing needs to be done.
      This \alert{parsimonious} property of Make is its best feature!

      \pitem
      Note: You have to keep the dependencies in your \verb+Makefile+
      up to date, otherwise \verb+make+ may not know to recompile something.

      \pitem
      If dependency maintenance irritates you, it's surprisingly easy to
      auto-generate Makefiles for single directory C projects - see tarball
      {\bf 02.c-mfbuild} and {\bf 03.perl-mfbuild} for two of my attempts.

      \pitem 
      Make continues to work well for any size project - as long as it's all stored
      in a single directory.

      %Summary: \alert{Always use make,} or some similar tool.
      %Keep your Makefile up to date, optionally auto-generating it.
      %Google \alert{make tutorial} for more info.

\section{Multi-directory Projects with Make}
\subsection{(tarball 04.intlist-with-lib)}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\myheading{Multi-directory Projects with Make}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  As a C project gets larger, you may wish to break it into several
  sub-directories.  Make doesn't handle this natively, but we can
  handle this with a \alert{Makefile} per directory and some cleverness.

  \pitem
  Each sub-directory should contain:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    One or more \alert{modules} (each a paired .c and .h file as usual).
    %\item
    %Ideally these modules should only depend on each other, and
    %the C standard library.
    \item
    Along with any associated test programs.
    \item
    Plus a Makefile that compiles all the .c files, builds all the test
    programs, and builds a \alert{library} containing the \alert{.o}
    files belonging to those modules.
  \end{itemize}

  \pitem
  Let's split our existing intlist and avgwordlen directory up.

  \item
  What to split?
  \pause
  The intlist module (and it's test program) is the obvious choice.  It's:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Logically separate - it's \alert{highly cohesive}.
    \item
    Reusable - whenever we want a list of integers.
    \item
    Depends on only the standard library.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  In tarball directory \alert{04.intlist-with-lib}, you'll see
  what we have done to achieve this:

  \pitem
  There's a separate \alert{lib} sub-directory to explore, which contains \alert{intlist.c, intlist.h, testlist.c} (all unmodified) and it's own Makefile,
  which builds two core targets:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    The executable \alert{testlist}.
    \item
    The library \alert{libintlist.a} containing \alert{intlist.o}.
  \end{itemize}
  \pitem
  To do this, \alert{lib/Makefile} has the following new parts:
\begin{verbatim}
LIB     =       libintlist.a
LIBOBJS =       intlist.o
BUILD   =       testlist $(LIB)
...
$(LIB):         $(LIBOBJS)
        ar rcs $(LIB) $(LIBOBJS)
\end{verbatim}

%\pitem
%In BUILD, I've added \verb+$(LIB)+ as an extra target.

\pitem
The new rule says that \verb+$(LIB)+ depends on \verb+$(LIBOBJS)+,
i.e. \verb+libintlist.a+ depends on \verb+intlist.o+, and that the action invokes 
\alert{ar} - the tool that builds library files.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\begin{itemize}
\item
The top-level directory contains \alert{avgwordlen.c}, \alert{defns.h} and a Makefile,
\pause
containing the following new parts:
\begin{verbatim}
CFLAGS  =       -Wall -Ilib
LDLIBS  =       -Llib -lintlist
BUILD   =       libs avgwordlen
\end{verbatim}

\pitem
In CFLAGS, \verb+-Ilib+ tells the C compiler to search for include files in
the lib directory.

\pitem
In LDLIBS, \verb+-Llib+ tells the linker to search for libraries in the lib directory, and \verb+-lintlist+ tells the linker
to link the intlist library in.

\pitem
In BUILD, I've added \alert{libs} before \alert{avgwordlen}.
Later down the main Makefile, we see a rule to make \alert{libs}:
\begin{verbatim}
libs:
        cd lib; make
\end{verbatim}

\pitem
This tricks Make, with it's \alert{single directory} view of the world,
into first building everything in the lib sub-directory,
before building \alert{avgwordlen} in the current directory.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Multi-directory Projects (tarball 05.libintlist)}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\begin{itemize}
\item
You'll also notice the \alert{clean} target now reads:
\begin{verbatim}
clean:
        /bin/rm -f $(BUILD) *.o core
        cd lib; make clean
\end{verbatim}
which makes it clean in both directories.

\pitem
Next: in tarball \alert{05.libintlist} and \alert{06.avgwordlen-only},
we go a step further:
we split the intlist module out completely from the
avgwordlen application that uses intlists.

\item
In brief: \alert{05.libintlist} contains only the files from
the \alert{lib} directory.

\pitem
It's Makefile adds a new \alert{install} target to install the library into
your \verb+~/c-tools/lib/x86_64+ directory,
and install intlist.h into \verb+~/c-tools/include+.

\pitem
After running \verb+make install+ in \alert{05.libintlist}, your
\verb+~/c-tools+ library permanently contains the intlist ADT, for you to
reuse whenever you like - as shown in \alert{06.avgwordlen-only}.

\pitem
Left for you to work through!

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{CMake (tarball 07.intlist-with-cmake)}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
        I recommend learning Make thoroughly, I've used it for many years
	with great success.
      \pitem
	But there are alternatives - or frontends - to Make:
	For example \alert{CMake} and \alert{Gnu autoconf} -
	both generate \alert{Makefiles} automatically from simpler
	inputs, and are supposed to scale well.
        %Let's briefly look at \alert{CMake}:

      \pitem
      In tarball \alert{07.intlist-with-cmake} you will find a copy of our
      familiar intlist-with-lib example, in which the \alert{only}
      differences are that the Makefiles have been replaced with
      CMakeLists.txt files, and the README has been modified to explain it.

      \pitem
      Go through that, and you'll get a taste of how CMake lists files
      are constructed.
      
      \pitem
      However: CMake is over complex for my tastes.  It generates Makefiles that
      are thousands of lines long, completely unnecessarily.
      Also, any tool that needs to be run in it's own \verb+build+
      subdirectory in order to leave the source code directory uncluttered
      is badly designed IMO.

      \pitem
      What about \alert{Gnu autoconf}?  It's widely used for portable software distribution,
      so is very powerful.  I have to admit it's still on my to-do list to learn - but don't
      let that stop you trying it out.

    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\section{Automating Compilation again}
\subsection{A New C-builder (tarball 08.cbuild)}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

  \myheading{CBuild: A New C-Builder}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item
      In 2020, while reviewing the Perl mfbuild program, an idle thought struck me:

    \pitem
      {\em How hard would it be to take the front end (dependency analysis)
      part of mfbuild, and instead of generating a Makefile and leaving
      the compilation and linking to Make, to do that myself.  How hard is
      it to write a simple make-style dependency algorithm?}

     \pitem
       So, I thought I'd have a go at it (clearly, time was hanging heavy on me
       in the first Lockdown:-)).  It turns out to be delightfully simple to
       do this.

      \pitem
      In \alert{tarball 08.cbuild} you will find the result.  May I present
      \alert{cb} - the new C builder.  
      First, go into that directory, look around,
      and then \alert{make install} - you now have a new \verb+cb+ command,
      and a man page \verb+man cb+ which explains how to use it.

    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \begin{itemize}

  \item
  There are 5 small C projects (in the test1..5 directories) which show off
  various features of \alert{cb} - including it's subdirectory support.  In
  particular, you will note that there is \alert{no Makefile} in any of
  those directories.

  \pitem
  However, in each directory there is a much simpler \verb+.cbuild+ file.
  Let's go inside \verb+test1+, look around. The \verb+.cbuild+ file reads:

\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
  BUILD   =       avgwordlen testlist
\end{verbatim}
\small

  \item
  Containing no rules, it looks very like one of the macro declarations
  from the top of a typical Makefile..
  \pause
  Later on, we'll see that less familiar declarations may be added to
  assist with multiple-directory work, installation and even testing.

  \pitem
  Now type \verb+cb+.  Lo and behold, the source code is compiled,
  exactly as make would have done.  
  Type \verb+cb+ again, and just like make, no compilations are needed -
  \alert{cb} is parsimonious too.

  \pitem
  Type \verb+cb clean+ and you'll see that it figures out what should be
  cleaned, all by itself.

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \begin{itemize}

  \item
  In \verb+test2+ you'll see how \alert{cb} supports building a library,
  and installing things.  It's \verb+.cbuild+ file has 3 parts:

\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
  # Library LIB will be built from LIBOBJS
  LIB     =       libintlist.a
  LIBOBJS =       intlist.o
\end{verbatim}

\pause
\begin{verbatim}
  # what to build
  BUILD   =       testlist $(LIB)
\end{verbatim}

\pause
\begin{verbatim}
  # installations to perform (each mode, source, destination)
  INST1   =       644 $(LIB) $(LIBDIR)
  INST2   =       644 intlist.h $(INCDIR)
\end{verbatim}
\small

  \pitem
  Type \verb+cb+ and the test program and the library are compiled
  and linked.  Type \verb+cb install+ and the library is installed
  into \verb+$(LIBDIR)+.  But where is LIBDIR set?  Look in
  \verb+../.cbuild+ and you'll see.  Settings are inherited from
  the \verb+.cbuild+ in the parent directory to save repitition.

  \pitem
  In the remaining test directories - left for you to investigate -
  you'll see examples of how \alert{cb} supports libraries in separate
  subdirectories,
  %- slightly better than Make does, in fact -
  and how it handles testing (via \verb+cb test+).

  \pitem
  \alert{cb} took me a couple of days to write - but of course it was
  based on the earlier Perl \alert{mfbuild} so perhaps half the code
  was already written.  It's still experimental, and it may not be
  feature complete.  But I've already started using it
  as a potential \alert{mfbuild+make} replacement.
  
  \item
  Give it a try - see what you think of it!  Please give me any feedback.
