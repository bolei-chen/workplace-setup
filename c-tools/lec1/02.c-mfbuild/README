- here we have my first attempt at building a tool to build Makefiles
  for simple C projects, dating to the late 1990s, called mfbuild.

- it works by determining which local .h files are included in a single main
  program, and assuming that if fred.h is included, and fred.c also
  exists, then they form a single 2-part module called fred, and hence
  fred.c should be analysed for which local .h files it includes, and
  fred.o will need to be linked with the main program, and so on.

- it implements a "first hack" at a "queue of strings" data structure,
  into which you enque strings onto the end and deque them from the front.
  This might be useful in other applications..

- build it by 'make' and install it into TOOLDIR/bin/ARCH by 'make install',
  complete with man page and standard all-project definitions

- note that there's now also a (more powerful) Perl version in
  03.perl-mfbuild, and there's little point in having both that C-version and
  the perl-version installed.  Pick one:-)  I suggest the Perl version.
