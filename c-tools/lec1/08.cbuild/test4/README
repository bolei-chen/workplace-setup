- In this version of the intlist + avgwrdlen example, the
  list-of-integers module (intlist.c and intlist.h) and
  it's test program (testlist.c) have been moved into the lib
  directory and made into a library - with it's own cbuild .build

- the .cbuild file in the lib directory tells cbuild to make two things:
  	- the executable testlist for us to test that intlist works
	  (note that the executable is generated in lib, i.e. run lib/testlist)
	- the library libintlist.a containing intlist.o

- all that remains in this top level directory is the real main
  program (avgwordlen.c), a set of shared definitions in defns.h,
  and a cbuild .build file that tells the C compiler to search for includes
  in the lib directory (-Ilib in CFLAGS), and to search for libraries
  in the lib directory (-Llib in LDLIBS), to link libintlist.a in
  (-lintlist also in LDLIBS), and that "lib" is a subdirectory that should
  be built too (first).

- SUBDIR = subdirs is a new feature in cbuild, implemented very crudely,
  that forces 'cb' to cd into each subdir and run itself there.

- so, to build, as before, type 'cb' and you'll notice it first cd into
  lib and run cb there - compiling intlist.c, testintlist.c, linking
  them together and then creating libintlist.a via ar.  Then, back in
  this directory, it analyses all the source code and compiles it.
