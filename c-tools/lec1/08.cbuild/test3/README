- Now that we've placed the list-of-integers module (intlist.c and intlist.h)
  into the c-tools library (see test2), this directory contains
  the real main program (avgwordlen.c), a set of shared definitions in defns.h,
  and a .cbuild file that tells the C compiler to search for includes
  in the c-tools include directory (-I... in CFLAGS), and to search for
  libraries in the c-tools lib directory (-L... in LDLIBS), and to link
  libintlist.a in (-lintlist also in LDLIBS).

- so, to build as always, type 'make' and you'll notice that it only
  compiles avgwordlen.c and then links it together with -lintlist.
