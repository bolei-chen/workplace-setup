- here, we have a copy of the fully separated list-of-integers module
  (intlist.c and intlist.h) and it's test program (testlist.c) from
  lecture 1.

- The .cbuild file knows how to build, and install:
  	- the executable testlist for us to test that intlist works
	- the library libintlist.a containing intlist.o, using ar.
