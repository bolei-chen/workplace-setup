C Programming Tools Lecture 1 Materials

PREPARATION

- Create a file ~/.c-tools containing the following:

# C Tools lecture support
if [ "$ARCH" == '' ]
then
  export ARCH=`arch`
fi
export TOOLDIR=$HOME/c-tools
export PATH="$TOOLDIR/bin:$TOOLDIR/bin/$ARCH:$PATH"
if [ "$MANPATH" == '' ]
then
  # note: this may disable other man pages, you could consider
  # setting export MANPATH=`manpath` beforehand, if you have the
  # "manpath" utility.
  export MANPATH=$TOOLDIR/man
else
  export MANPATH=${MANPATH}:$TOOLDIR/man
fi

- Edit your ~/.bashrc and your ~/.bash_profile files, creating them if they
  don't already exist, and add the following stanza at the bottom of both:

  source ~/.c-tools

- then run your .c-tools right now by: "source ~/.c-tools"

- prove that you have the TOOLDIR and ARCH variables set up by:

env | grep TOOLDIR
env | grep ARCH

- double check by logging out and logging in again, do the same
  checks as just above.

DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL both TOOLDIR and ARCH are correctly set.

- then:

	make mkdir

- see what that has created by:
	find ~/c-tools

- Preparation is now complete.  Phew!

[If you run into difficulties with the Preparation stage: try ssh'ing in to
a DoC linux shell server and then into a randomly chosen lab machine, and work
there, doing all the preparation there.  Feel free to ask a question on EdStem
about how to solve whatever problem you encountered].


Then sequence through the following directories, exploring each
directory, and following the instructions in each directory's README.

- 01.intlist
	- this is the make example
	- details in 01.intlist's README,
	  explore it as much as you like.

- 02.c-mfbuild
	- for those interested, here's my first attempt at building
	  a tool to build Makefiles for simple C projects, written
	  in C, dating to the late 1990s, called mfbuild.

- 03.perl-mfbuild
	- for those interested, here's my second attempt at building
	  a tool to build Makefiles for simple C projects,
	  dating to 2016, written in Perl this time, also called mfbuild.
	- I recommend that you choose this one, go into this directory and
	  type "make install" to give yourself an "mfbuild" command.

- 04.intlist-with-lib
	- this is the 01.intlist example, split into a separate library
	  directory called lib (containing the intlist module and it's
	  test program), and the top level directory (containing the
	  avgwordlen main program and a Makefile to build the library,
	  include it and link to it.

- 05.libintlist
	- here, the list-of-integers module (intlist.c and intlist.h) and
	  it's test program (testlist.c) are entirely separated from
	  applications (eg. the avgwordlen program) that USE intlists.
	- now, the Makefile has a new "install" target, to install the library
	  in the TOOLDIR/lib/ARCH directory, and intlist.h into TOOLDIR/include.
	- once you've gone into this directory and run "make install", your
	  TOOLDIR library permanently contains the intlist ADT, for us to
	  reuse in other apps whenever we like.

- 06.avgwordlen-only
	- this contains the real application program (avgwordlen.c) that uses
	  intlists from the TOOLDIR library, and a Makefile that tells the C
	  compiler to look in the library both for includes and libraries,
	  and specifically to link in -lintlist.
	- together, 05.libintlist and 06.avgwordlen-only show how to do full
	  separation: your TOOLDIR library permanently contains the intlist
	  ADT, for us to reuse in other apps whenever we like.

- 07.intlist-with-cmake
	- a version of 04.intlist-with-lib using CMake to generate the
	  Makefiles for us.  The source code is IDENTICAL to
	  04.intlist-with-lib, the Makefiles have been replaced with
	  CMakeLists.txt files (and the README has been modified to
	  explain it).

- 08.cbuild
	- here we have a new idea of mine (2020): analyse C source files like
	  the Perl mfbuild does, but DON'T write a Makefile: instead, let's
	  "be make" as well, i.e. analyse the dependencies live, build
	  internal make-style rules, and then execute those rules just as
	  Make would have done.  I'm rather proud of this tool, as it now
	  has some support for multi-directory work (which of course make
	  doesn't have).  New for 2022: I've added support into cbuild
	  for nested includes (even though I hate them).  New for Dec 2022:
	  I've added a companion tool "cr" that compiles, links and then runs
	  a C program.
