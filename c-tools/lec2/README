C Tools Lecture 2 Materials

You should ALREADY have all the C-Tools preparation code at the end
of your ~/.bashrc from Lecture 1.  Check by:

echo $TOOLDIR


Sequence through the following directories,
following the instructions in each directory's README.

- 01.string-debug:
	- using gdb to debug some dodgy C code that segmentation faults
	  when we run it.

- 02.badhash
	- large-scale memory leak bug.
	- investigate and understand the bizarre behaviour.

- 03.hash-profile
	- profile the bugfixed hash module with gprof
	  and see what surprises await.
	- a simple optimization suggested by the gprof
	  report DOUBLES the speed of the hash module.
	- and that's not a put up job, I've been using
	  the hash module for years w/o profiling it!

- 04.testutils
	- summarisetests and a trivial bool checking testutils.h
	- go in there and "make install" otherwise later examples
	  will not work.

- 05.intlist-with-testing
	- our old intlist example, with added testing
